# d-minimum branch problem

This repository contains code for solving the d-minimum branch problem.

## Problem statement

Given an undirected graph G = (V, E) with n = |V| vertices, the d-Minimum Branch Vertices (d-MBV) problem consists in finding a spanning tree of G with the minimum number of vertices with degree strictly greater than a fixed integer value d, (d â‰¥ 2).

In other words, the problem is to find a spanning tree of the graph such that the number of vertices with degree greater than d is minimized. A spanning tree of a graph is a subgraph that connects all the vertices of the graph and has no cycles.

The d-minimum branch problem is a NP-hard problem, which means that it is computationally difficult to solve in general. However, there are a number of approximation algorithms that can be used to find a solution that is close to optimal.
